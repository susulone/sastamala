        Sastamala is a town and municipality in Pirkanmaa. It was created when
        the municipalities of <strong>Vammala</strong>,
        <strong>Äetsä</strong> and <strong>Mouhijärvi</strong> were consolidated
        into a signle town in 2009. Later <strong>Kiikoinen</strong> also joined
        the growing Sastamala in 2013.

        The current name of Sastamala is actually a revival of the Medieval name
        of the area. The first mention of Sastamala was in the 1303 AD.
